## ⚡ Install in one command

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frosty-universe/usb-android-tethering/main/install.sh | sh
```

This downloads the latest universal binary (Apple Silicon and Intel), **verifies its SHA-256 checksum**, and installs a background service. You'll be asked for your password once. Then [enable USB tethering on your phone](#step-2) and you're online.

<sub>Prefer to read the script first? It's short: <a href="install.sh"><code>install.sh</code></a>. Or <a href="#build-from-source">build from source</a>.</sub>

## 🤔 Why this exists

Most Android phones tether over **RNDIS**, a Microsoft protocol that **macOS has never supported**. The classic fix, the HoRNDIS kernel extension, no longer loads on current macOS, and on Apple Silicon any kext means lowering your Mac's boot security.

Tools that work around this with a *tunnel* interface (`utun`) create a new problem: **VPN apps ignore tunnel interfaces** when choosing the network to run over. You end up with tethering *or* your VPN, not both.

**usb-android-tethering** gives macOS what it expects: a genuine **Ethernet adapter**, backed by a real network service.

## ✨ Highlights

- 🔌 **Works like a physical Ethernet adapter.** macOS's own Network framework reports it as `wiredEthernet`, just like a USB Ethernet dongle ([verified](#physical-adapter)). It appears in *System Settings → Network* as **"USB Android Tethering"**.
- 🛡️ **VPN-compatible.** Your VPN runs over it like over any wired network. Only IPv4 is bridged, so IPv6 can't leak around the VPN.
- 🤖 **Universal Android support.**
  - **RNDIS**, used by most phones, with matching that follows Linux's reference driver.
  - **CDC-NCM and CDC-ECM** (Pixel 6+, newer phones) whenever macOS's own driver doesn't pick the phone up.
  - Detection is by USB interface class, not a model list, so any brand works.
- 🔁 **Set and forget.** It starts at boot and connects the moment you plug in. It reconnects after unplugging, sleep or a phone reboot, and recovers by itself from crashes.
- 🪶 **Light.**
  - Asynchronous USB I/O with multi-packet aggregation.
  - A kernel packet filter.
  - No polling while idle.
  - About 7 MB of memory.
- 🔒 **Safe by design.**
  - No kernel code; your Mac's security settings stay as they are.
  - Everything is removed on uninstall.
  - The installer verifies checksums.
  - [Security model](SECURITY.md).
- 🧰 **Scriptable.** `status` and `devices` support `--json`, logs are leveled and rotated, and exit codes are stable.

```console

## 📖 Step-by-step guide

### Step 1 — Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frosty-universe/usb-android-tethering/main/install.sh | sh
```

You need macOS on Apple Silicon or Intel and your password once. The service then starts automatically at every boot.

<a id="step-2"></a>
### Step 2 — Turn on USB tethering on the phone

1. Connect the phone to the Mac with a USB **data** cable. Charge-only cables don't work.
2. Unlock the phone and open USB tethering:

| Phone | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| Samsung | Settings → Connections → Mobile Hotspot and Tethering → **USB tethering** |
| Google Pixel | Settings → Network & internet → Hotspot & tethering → **USB tethering** |
| Any other Android | Settings → search for **"USB tethering"** |

> 💡 **Fully automatic option:** turn on *USB debugging* (Developer options) and install `adb` (`brew install android-platform-tools`). The tool then switches USB tethering on by itself whenever you plug the phone in. Tap **Allow** once on the phone's prompt.

### Step 3 — You're online

Within a few seconds macOS switches to the phone. Check it:

```sh
usb-android-tethering status
```

You'll see "USB Android Tethering" as connected in *System Settings → Network*. Unplug the phone and your Mac falls back to Wi-Fi automatically.

### Step 4 — Use your VPN as usual

Connect your VPN after the phone is online, and it runs over the tether exactly as it would over Ethernet. If a VPN was already connected before you plugged in, reconnect it once.

### Step 5 — Update or uninstall

```sh
# Update to the latest release (same command as installing)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frosty-universe/usb-android-tethering/main/install.sh | sh

# Uninstall completely (service, network entry, binary, logs)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frosty-universe/usb-android-tethering/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall
```

## 🔌 Just like a physical adapter

The phone shows up to macOS the way a USB Ethernet dongle does, at every layer apps and VPN clients look at:

| Layer | What macOS sees |
|---|---|
| Network framework (`NWPathMonitor`, used by apps and VPN clients) | `feth7070: wiredEthernet`, first on the path. Not "expensive", not "constrained". |
| System Settings → Network | A service named **"USB Android Tethering"**, Hardware *Ethernet*, configured by DHCP |
| System configuration | Ranked by service order like any adapter: primary while connected, falls back to Wi-Fi |
| Routing and DNS | Installed by macOS itself (its own DHCP client, scoped routes, resolver) |
| Kernel | A real Ethernet interface (a `feth` pair) with its own MAC and ARP, not a layer-3 tunnel |

Under the hood the tool is a userspace USB driver bridging the phone to that interface. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 📱 Device support

| Phone | Handled by |
|---|---|
| Android with **RNDIS**: Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus, OPPO/realme, vivo, Huawei/Honor, Motorola, Sony, LG, Nokia/HMD, ASUS, ZTE, Lenovo, Fairphone and others | **This tool** (verified on Samsung) |
| Android with **CDC-NCM** (Pixel 6+, newer phones) | macOS's built-in driver if it claims the phone, otherwise **this tool** |
| Devices with **CDC-ECM** | macOS's built-in driver if it claims it, otherwise **this tool** |
| iPhone / iPad | Built into macOS (Personal Hotspot); `devices` tells you so |

`usb-android-tethering devices` shows what's attached and what to do about each device. The NCM/ECM userspace path is covered by unit tests but hasn't yet been verified on a phone that macOS doesn't claim. **[Device reports](https://github.com/frosty-universe/usb-android-tethering/issues/new/choose) are very welcome.**

## 🧭 Commands

| Command | Root | Description |
|---|:---:|---|
| `status [--json]` | | Service state, address, traffic, primary network |
| `devices [--json]` | | Attached phones, whether each can tether, and advice |
| `probe` | | Test the phone link (USB + DHCP) without changing anything |
| `run` *(default)* | ✓ | Run in the foreground (Ctrl+C restores everything) |
| `install` / `uninstall [--purge]` | ✓ | Install or remove the background service |
| `cleanup` | ✓ | Remove leftovers after a crash (normally automatic) |

Options: `-v`/`-vv` (debug/trace), `-q` (quiet), `--log-file PATH`, `--once`, `--no-primary` (keep Wi-Fi preferred), `--no-adb`.
Exit codes: `0` success · `1` failure · `2` usage error · `130` forced stop.

## 🧾 What it changes on your Mac

| Item | Removed by |
|---|---|
| `/usr/local/bin/usb-android-tethering` | `uninstall` |
| `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.usb-android-tethering.plist` | `uninstall` |
| Network service "USB Android Tethering" | `uninstall` |
| Interfaces `feth7070`/`feth7071` (only while connected) | Automatically |
| `/var/log/usb-android-tethering.log` | `uninstall --purge` |

Nothing else is touched: no kernel extensions, no changes to other network services, DNS or firewall.

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `devices` lists nothing | Use a data cable and try another port. Unlock the phone. |
| "USB tethering is off" | Turn it on (Step 2), or use the automatic option |
| `Access denied` claiming the interface | Another tethering driver (HoRNDIS, DroidTether, …) holds the phone. Remove it. |
| Online, but no internet | Check the phone has mobile data. `status` should show `feth7070` as primary. |
| VPN still uses Wi-Fi | Reconnect the VPN once the phone is online |
| Anything else | `sudo usb-android-tethering -vv` shows everything, or read `/var/log/usb-android-tethering.log` |

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Is it safe? It asks for my password.</b></summary>

Creating a network interface and a system network service needs administrator rights, like any network driver. The tool contains no kernel code, opens no network ports, and runs its optional `adb` helper as your user, never as root. The installer refuses to run anything whose checksum doesn't match the release. The full model is in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why not a kernel extension?</b></summary>

On Apple Silicon, third-party kexts require "Reduced Security" boot mode and a reboot. DriverKit needs entitlements Apple grants case by case. A userspace driver avoids both, can't panic the kernel, and is far faster than any cellular connection needs. [More detail](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#why-userspace).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it drain the battery or keep the Mac awake?</b></summary>

No. While idle it waits on events and uses 0 % CPU, and it never prevents sleep.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I keep Wi-Fi as my main network?</b></summary>

Yes. Install with `--no-primary` and the phone becomes a fallback that's used only when Wi-Fi is unavailable.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why IPv4 only?</b></summary>

So IPv6 can't bypass a VPN that only tunnels IPv4. Almost every service is dual-stack. IPv6-only destinations need a VPN that carries IPv6.
