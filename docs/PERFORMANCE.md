# Performance

This document describes how performance is measured, the current results, and what limits throughput. The design choices behind these numbers are covered in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## What limits throughput

For almost every user, **the mobile network is the bottleneck, not this program.** A USB 2.0 High-Speed link can carry roughly 35–40 MB/s of payload, and comparable userspace RNDIS drivers have been measured at about 300 Mbit/s. The tests below ran at 1.5–3 MB/s because that is what the phone's cellular connection delivered.

What the program itself controls, and what this document tracks, is **cost**: the CPU time spent per megabyte carried, and how often it wakes up when there's nothing to do.

## Methodology

Run `scripts/bench.sh [label] [bytes]` against an online tether. It needs no root.

- **CPU time** comes from `ps` for the tether process (not the crash guard).
- **Bytes carried** come from the tether's own counters (`status --json`, `rx_bytes + tx_bytes`).
- Both are sampled right after the status file refreshes, so they cover the same interval. Background traffic (other apps, a VPN's keep-alives) is counted on *both* sides of the ratio instead of skewing it.
- Load is a download of `bytes` (default 30 MB) from `speed.cloudflare.com`.
- The headline metric is **CPU per MB carried**. Raw speed is reported but reflects the mobile network.

Because the cost per byte depends on packet sizes (many small packets cost more than a few full-size ones), always compare builds on the same machine, phone and traffic mix.

## Results

**Environment:**
- MacBook, Apple Silicon, macOS 26.
- Samsung phone (`04e8:6863`), which accepts 15 frames / 23,700 B per transfer, alignment 16.
- A VPN (sing-box based) running over the tether and carrying continuous background traffic.

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| CPU per MB carried | **37–42 ms** (three runs; one run failed on a TLS error and was discarded) |
| CPU at 2.2 MB/s | 8.7–9.1 % of one core |
| CPU with only background VPN traffic | 3.6–5.5 % |
| Memory (RSS) | ~7 MB |
| Round-trip time to the phone | 2.9 ms average (`ping` to the phone's gateway address) |
| Frames macOS emits that aren't IPv4 or ARP | Dropped in the kernel, never copied to userspace (verified with `netstat -B`: 5 injected IPv6 frames rejected, ARP accepted) |

Sample output:

```
== run 1 (pid 3207)
background (10 s): cpu 5.5%  idle wakeups 64
download:          30000000 B at 2146988 B/s
carried:           35.1 MB in 15.0 s (2.3 MB/s)
cpu:               1.30 s = 8.7% of one core
cpu per MB:        37.1 ms
memory (RSS):      7.0 MB
```

### Optimisation history

| Version | Change | Measured effect |
|---|---|---|
| v1 | Synchronous transfers, one frame per transfer, 1 s polling | Baseline: 2.1 % CPU and ~78 wakeups/s with no traffic |
| v2 | Async receive ring (8) and transmit pool (8), RNDIS multi-packet aggregation, hotplug instead of polling | Wakeups with little traffic fell to about 1–4/s; CPU per MB fell by 20–40 % against v1 under the same conditions |
| v3 | Kernel BPF filter, self-pipe (no timer in the transmit thread), allocation-free packing, per-transfer counters, write-on-change status file | Wakeups with little traffic fell below 1/s |

> **Measurement note.** Figures quoted for v1–v3 during development divided the process's CPU time by the size of the test download only, ignoring background traffic, so they aren't comparable with the per-MB-carried numbers above. They are kept only as relative comparisons made under the same conditions. Use `scripts/bench.sh` for anything new.

## Tuning knobs (source constants)

| Constant | File | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RX_QUEUE` | `tether.rs` | 8 | Receive transfers kept queued. Raise it if the phone ever stalls waiting for buffers at very high rates. |
| `TX_QUEUE` | `tether.rs` | 8 | Transmit transfers in flight. Raise it for heavy uploads over high-latency USB hubs. |
| `HOST_MAX_TRANSFER` | `rndis.rs` | 16 KiB | Largest receive transfer we accept, announced to the phone. It bounds the phone's download aggregation. |
| `BPF_BUF` | `feth.rs` | 256 KiB | Kernel buffer for frames from macOS. It bounds the batch size per read. |

## Ideas not yet pursued

- **Per-frame BPF writes on receive.** BPF accepts one frame per `write()`, so each received frame costs one system call. An `NDRV` socket has the same limit. A batched injection path would need a kernel component.
- **Larger download aggregation.** Android decides how many frames to aggregate per download transfer (`rndis_dl_max_pkt_per_xfer`, often 3 or less). Announcing a larger `HOST_MAX_TRANSFER` only helps phones configured for more.
