# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are made on the latest release and on `main`.

| Version | Supported |

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please don't open a public issue for security problems.**

Report privately through GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/frosty-universe/usb-android-tethering/security/advisories/new) (the repository's *Security* tab → *Report a vulnerability*). Please include:

- the affected version or commit, and the macOS version;
- a description of the issue and its impact;
- steps to reproduce, or a proof of concept if you have one.

You can expect an acknowledgement within **5 days** and a first assessment within **14 days**. Fixes are released as soon as practical. We credit reporters in the release notes unless you'd rather stay anonymous.

## Security model

`usb-android-tethering` is a network driver, and its background service runs as **root**. The design keeps that privilege as narrow as possible.

### Trust boundaries

| Input | Trust | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| USB data from the phone (RNDIS messages, NCM transfer blocks, CDC descriptors, serial number) | **Untrusted** | All parsing is bounds-checked, never panics on malformed input, and bounds pointer chains such as NCM's NDP list (covered by unit tests). The serial number is only passed to `adb` as a separate argument, never through a shell. |
| Frames from macOS on the virtual NIC | Trusted (local kernel) | Filtered in the kernel to IPv4 and ARP |
| Command-line arguments | Local user | Parsed by clap. Commands that change the system require root. |
| `adb` binary (optional) | **User-writable location** | Never executed as root. It runs as the logged-in console user, only if owned by root or that user and not group- or world-writable. |

### What runs as root, and why

| Action | Why root is needed |
|---|---|
| Creating the `feth` interfaces and opening `/dev/bpf*` | Kernel network configuration |
| Editing the network service (`scutil --prefs`) | System network preferences |
| Installing the launchd daemon and binary | System locations |

The daemon opens **no network sockets** and listens on nothing. It exchanges frames only with the phone (USB) and the local kernel (BPF).

### Files

| Path | Owner / mode | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/usr/local/bin/usb-android-tethering` | `root:wheel 0755` | Enforced by `install`, so no other user can replace code that runs as root |
| `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.usb-android-tethering.plist` | `root:wheel 0644` | |
| `/var/run/usb-android-tethering.json` | root, world-readable | Status only (addresses, counters). No secrets. Replaced atomically. |
| `/var/log/usb-android-tethering.log` | root | Contains no traffic contents |

### Network exposure

- Only IPv4 and ARP cross the bridge, so IPv6 can't bypass an IPv4 VPN.
- The phone routes your traffic, like any hotspot. Treat the phone and the mobile carrier as you would any network operator, and use a VPN if you don't trust them.

## Hardening checklist for contributors

- No `unsafe` without a comment explaining why it's sound.
- Code that parses device data must bounds-check and must not panic.
- Never pass device-controlled strings to a shell.
- Never execute a binary from a user-writable location as root.
- Keep root-owned files non-writable by other users.
